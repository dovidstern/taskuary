// "New task → Ask the assistant" opened the chat on the right task and left it EMPTY: the
// prompt the owner typed never got asked (TQ-0275 "Whats up", 2026-08-31).
//
// Two faults, both of them about a task's data belonging to that task:
//   1. `detail` is not cleared when the selection changes, so for one render it still holds the
//      PREVIOUS task - and the decision was made from that one's Kind, Summary and repo.
//   2. the seed was cleared "whenever the selection changes", which is the very event that
//      produced it: set and wiped in the same commit, gone before the chat mounted.
